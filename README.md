# Picardy_Protocol
The Picardy Third Protocol is a protocol built with modularity in mind while carrying out its ultimate goal, to empower artiste/creators to be independent and take control of their income and royalties. The modularity makes it easy for platforms to plug and play it’s functions from the Picardy Hub. 
This is achieved by the ability for artists and creators to tokenize their names, brands or events for their audience. The Picardy Protocol allows artists to mint their (uri) profiles as NFTs which is the backbone of our distribution platform and protocol, as it holds all the activities of each artiste or creators (somewhat like a database that stores that songs, NFT photos). 
The protocol allows the artists and creators to create royalty tokens (ERC721 and ERC 20 respectively), which they can sell a percentage of their royalties, for their projects. This makes it possible for fans to earn from holding a percentage of royalties from their favorite person. 
The protocol also allows the creation of crowdfunding for artists or projects from other creators. 
The Picardy Protocol wouldn’t be complete without the ability to create Vaults which are governed by the DAO (the community). The various vaults created are to be invested in DeFi protocols, investing in independent artists who have been voted by the community and in conjunction with our primary music distribution platform to create distribution deals.
